myPREP is a text aligner software, a tool which makes possible to automatically align two by two the documents in a multilingual corpus. The outcome of the alignment is a translation memory in TMX format. The alignment is done at the sentence level.<!--more-->

Thanks to myPREP, the production of training corpus for statistical translation is also possible (in [Moses](https://www.statmt.org/moses/) format). Such corpora are divided into several parts for the training, the tuning and the evaluation.

myPREP also makes possible the alignment of comparable corpora. The outcome of the alignment is a set of pair of sentences associated with a score, the number of aligned terms, and the length of sentences. These functions can control the alignments.

myPREP requires segmented documents corpora in UTF-8 format. The converter and the segmentation tool of the myCAT software are included in the installation of myPREP.

myPREP is available for both Windows and for GNU/Linux (Ubuntu 12.04); please find the links to the respective installation files below. As for the sources, they are the same for both versions.
